### Dice App

A simple dice app made with Swift. Click 'roll' (or shake the phone) and the di will produce two numbers. The total of these two di will also displayed after each roll.

### How it works

Function rollButtonPressed() is executed when the 'roll' button is pressed, triggering the function updateDiceImages(). This function has two pseudo-random number methods which produce a number between 0 and 5, which are both used as the index of the diceArray (which contains 'dice1' ... 'dice6') to display an image of a dice. The index of the array dictates the number shown on the dice. This function also adds the total of the random numbers (and adds 2) in order to display the total of the di shown on the device, having parsed the total into a string.

updateDiceImages() is also in viewDidLoad() so the di are rolled automatically upon opening the app, as well as when you touch the 'Roll' button or shake the phone. The function is fired once the shaking motion has finished, although you could choose to have it fire as soon as the shaking begins using 'motionBegan' rather than 'motionEnded'.


### Sample Code

``` swift
 func updateDiceImages() {
        
        randomDiceIndex1 = Int.random(in: 0 ... 5)
        randomDiceIndex2 = Int.random(in: 0 ... 5)
        total = (randomDiceIndex1 + randomDiceIndex2) + 2
        
        diceImageView1.image = UIImage(named: diceArray[randomDiceIndex1])
        diceImageView2.image = UIImage(named: diceArray[randomDiceIndex2])
        totalAmountView.text = String(total)
    
      }
  }
```

### Installation
```
$ git clone git@github.com:jdm79/swift-dice-app.git
```
* Open swift-dice-app in Xcode
* Run the app in the simulator by pressing play in the top-left corner of the screen on Xcode

The app can be side-loaded onto your actual iPhone if your iOS version is the same as the Xcode version. Then you simply use a USB cord and select 'Product'>'Destination' from the Xcode toolbar, choose your device and then run the app by clicking 'play' in the top-left corner of the screen. Once the app has been built and installed on your phone, it will launch the app automatically for you.
